<H1>What is Favicon.ico? Personalise Your Site's Bookmarks</H1>
<H2>What is this mysterious FAVICON.ICO in your web server 
logs?</H2></DIV></DIV>
<DIV class=maincontent>
<H1>What is Favicon.ico? Personalise Your Site's Bookmark</H1>by Christopher 
Heng, <A href="http://www.thesitewizard.com/" 
target=_top>thesitewizard.com</A><BR>
<P>Some time back, I had an email from a visitor asking me how I managed to have 
<A href="http://www.thefreecountry.com/" target=_top>thefreecountry.com's</A> 
icon displayed next to my URL in his browser's location bar. In fact, had he 
checked carefully, he would also have noticed that the icon is also used in his 
"Favorites" menu. </P>
<P>Internet Explorer ("IE") 5.0 and above has a facility where, if someone 
bookmarks your website (ie puts it in their "Favorites" menu), it associates a 
particular icon with your website in the bookmark. It tries to obtain that icon 
by first requesting for "favicon.ico" from the directory of your web page. If it 
cannot find such a file, it will try to obtain it from the root directory of 
your website, failing which, it will simply use a default icon for the bookmark. 
</P>
<P>On the other hand, the favicon.ico file is available, the icon will also be 
displayed beside your website name in the "Favorites" menu, the location bar in 
IE, and if the user opens up the "Favorites" folder, it will be the icon used 
for the link to your site. </P>
<P><A href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</A>, and probably also the new 
versions of Netscape (which are based on Mozilla), also have the ability to use 
the favicon.ico file, except that Mozilla also accepts the file in other 
graphics formats, such as the PNG format. It displays the "favicon.ico" in the 
location bar of the browser (the part that shows your website's URL). The latest 
version of <A 
href="http://www.regnow.com/softsell/visitor.cgi?affiliate=16087&amp;action=site&amp;vendor=7000">Opera</A> 
also loads the favicon.ico file into the address bar if available. </P>
<H2>Software Requirements</H2>
<P>If you have an Windows icon editor (which you may already have if you have 
purchased a programming language development system for Windows), you're all 
set. </P>
<P>All is not lost, however, if you do not have the above. Simply pop over to <A 
href="http://www.thefreecountry.com/programming/resourceeditors.shtml" 
target=_top>thefreecountry.com's Free Resource Editors and Icon Editors</A> page 
at <A href="http://www.thefreecountry.com/programming/resourceeditors.shtml" 
target=_top>http://www.thefreecountry.com/programming/resourceeditors.shtml</A> 
and get yourself one. That page lists a few free icon editors and resource 
editors. Just choose any of the icon editors that strikes your fancy and 
download it. Alternatively, you can also download one of the other packages that 
contain a resource editor. Resource editors are tools that programmers use to 
create and edit Windows "resources" like icons, cursors (ie, mouse pointers), 
menus, dialog boxes, etc. For our purpose here, you will only need to use the 
icon editor portion of such resource editors. </P>
<H2>How to Create a "Favicon.ico" File</H2>
<OL class=content>
  <LI>
  <P>Create an image 16X16 pixels in size. Yes, it is really small and you can't 
  really draw much in it. You should also restrict yourself to the standard 
  Windows 16 colours, although I suspect that 256 colours will work fine. </P>
  <P>If you like, you can also create a 32X32 pixel icon, which will be scaled 
  to size for the Favorites menu and the location bar. You can even put both 
  16X16 and 32X32 pixel icons into the same icon file. Windows will use the 
  former for its menus and the latter when the user opens up a folder that is 
  set to display large icons. It's probably not really necessary to do this if 
  you can't be bothered. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>Save the image as an ICO file (named "favicon.ico", of course). </P>
  <LI>
  <P>Upload it to your website. You don't need to upload one to every directory 
  of your site if you don't want to waste space - simply put it in your root 
  directory and IE will apparently locate it eventually. You can also upload it 
  into your images directory, but you will need to modify your web pages if you 
  do. See later in this article for more information on this.</P></LI></OL>
<H2>Help! My Web Host Doesn't Allow ICO Files!</H2>
<P>If your hosting company does not allow files with the .ICO extension to be 
uploaded, you might try to work around it by uploading it (in binary mode) with 
some other extension (like GIF). Once it's on your site, rename it using your 
FTP program to the correct extension. </P>
<H2>Helping the Browser Locate the favicon.ico file</H2>
<P>If you have placed your favicon.ico file in a location other than the current 
web directory (relative to your web page) or the root directory, you have to 
help your visitors' browser locate the favicon file by specifying it with a tag 
like the following in the &lt;head&gt; section of your web page. </P>
<DIV class=codeblock><CODE>&lt;link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.ico" 
type="image/x-icon" /&gt; </CODE></DIV>
<P>You should replace "/favicon.ico" in the above example with the actual 
location of your favicon.ico file, for example, "/images/favicon.ico" if you 
have placed it in your "/images/" directory. </P>
<P>This step is optional if you have put your "favicon.ico" file in the standard 
locations, ie, in the same directory as the web page or in the root directory of 
your website. Otherwise you will need to modify all your existing web pages to 
take advantage of the "favicon.ico" facility. </P>
<H2>How Many People are Bookmarking My Website?</H2>
<P>This "favicon.ico" used to have an interesting side-effect. The side-effect 
applied whether or not you bothered to put a special "favicon.ico" on your site. 
You used to be able to find out the number of IE 5 users who bookmarked your 
site by simply counting the requests for "favicon.ico" in your web server logs. 
From that number, you can estimate the total number of people who bookmark your 
site by applying this formula: number of IE 5 bookmarks divided by the fraction 
of your visitors using IE 5. </P>
<P>For example, if two-thirds of your visitors use IE 5+, and you get 100 
requests for the icon, simply divide 100 by two-thirds to get 150. This was by 
no means an accurate measure - it did not take into account numerous factors: 
but at least it was able to give you a hint of how useful people find your site. 
</P>
<P>However, this side effect is no longer relevant today. Mozilla, Netscape and 
Opera load the favicon.ico to display in your visitors' location bar whether 
they put your site in their favourites (or bookmarks) or not. Apparently the Mac 
OS X browser, Safari, also loads the favicon.ico file whenever it visits a site 
(it uses it in the history menu). I've not checked the latest version of IE so 
I'm not sure if it does the same too. I merely mention this "side-effect" so 
that you won't deceive yourself when you see the large number of "favicon.ico" 
requests in your web logs: it doesn't tell you that those your visitors 
bookmarked your site anymore. </P>
<H2>Miscellaneous Matters</H2>
<P>If you are testing your favicon file in Internet Explorer, and find that 
you're seeing an old version of your favicon.ico file, you probably need to 
empty your browser's cache (and possible restart the browser). Internet Explorer 
caches the favicon.ico file in the "Temporary Internet Files" folder, so if you 
don't empty the cache, you'll probably continue to see your old version and not 
the new version that you've created. Incidentally, this also means that if your 
visitors empty their cache, their copy of the favicon.ico file that was 
associated with the bookmark of your site will also be lost. </P>
<H2>Conclusion</H2>
<P>The "favicon.ico" facility is by no means essential to your website's 
operation. In fact, few people even notice its existence, and its really too 
small to put anything useful in it. However, creating one can save your site 
some bandwidth if you have created a <A 
href="http://www.thesitewizard.com/archive/custom404.shtml" target=_top>custom 
404 File Not Found error file</A> - that file will be sent by your web server 
everytime there is a request for a nonexistent "favicon.ico" file. Perhaps more 
importantly, creating such an icon adds to the professionalism of your site, 
marking you as a web designer who attends to detail. </P>
