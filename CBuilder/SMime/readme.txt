This program shows how to build, sign and encrypt
email messages using the TclSMime component.

Before running the SMime program you must have the corresponding
certificate which allows you to securely sign email messages.

Note! The most popular email clients require that the From field
should be the same as the name in your certificate.
To avoid possible message validation errors please keep the
From field value the same as in your certificate.
